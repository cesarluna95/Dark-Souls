  <br> From Software has a reputation for creating the most difficult games of our generation. Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and the newly released Elden Ring all challenge the very core of your gaming skills from patience, timing, coordination, and sheer will-power. 
  A difficulty that satisfies even the deepest inner-pleasures of the psyche. When you embark on a From Software game (and dedicate your time and ultimate attention) you will enter a feeble and naive gamer, but upon completion you will have a new-found power and
  courage to analyse and break the inner mechanics of every game you play after.</br>
