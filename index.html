  <br> Majula Theme by Motoi Sakuraba and Yuka Kitamura delivers a sense of wonder and angst as you begin to engage a world of death and despair.</br>

    <p class="big">From Software has a reputation for creating the most difficult games of our generation. Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and the newly released Elden Ring all challenge the very core of your gaming skills from patience, timing, coordination, and sheer will-power. 
  A difficulty that satisfies even the deepest inner-pleasures of the psyche. When you embark on a From Software game (and dedicate your time and ultimate attention) you will enter a feeble and naive gamer, but upon completion you will have a new-found power and
  courage to analyse and break the inner mechanics of every game you play after.</br></p>

    <p class="big">Once dropped into a huge forsaken world of pain, From Software (in the most unforgiving and unrelenting fashion) sends you into the most cryptic and liminal journey to collect souls and rid yourself of "Hollow" or the most subjugative and subduing elment of
    death that benumbs and weakens your character. You are actively emboldened by not only the developers, but the entire Dark Souls Community at large, to engage, research online, and collaborte amongst eachother to defeat the fiercest and mightiest bosses in all of contemporary
    videogame culture. If you wish to dedicate yourself to the community, From Software allows your character to join a Covenant called "The Warriors of Sunlight" who travel across playthroughs offering their services in defeating those pesky bosses you are stuck on. </br></p>
  <br> Watch as this player utilizes his conquering of what Freud calls "Fort-Da" or the "repetition-compulsion" of his trauma from his first battle with Iudex Gundyr to dominate this demon.</br>
